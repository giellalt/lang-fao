This file documents installation of the Faroese analysers.


Prerequisites:
==============
You must have a Unix system (Linux or Mac), and a terminal supporting
UTF-8.  Mac users must make sure they have standard developer tools
installed, from the developer tools on the Mac OS system CD.

In order to compile the analyser you need compilers from __one__ of
these two sites (both are not needed, they compile the same
analysers):

* xerox tools: http://fsmbook.com
* hfst tools:  http://sourceforge.projects.net/hfst/

The xerox tools are available as binary compilers, for non-commercial
use. You will need both lexc, xfst, lookup and twolc. All the programs
must be installed in a folder in your path.

The hfst tools are open source. Follow the instructions in the downloaded folders

At present (2010), the xerox tools are better tested and supported,
and easier to install (no compilation needed). Hfst is open source and
without restrictions, and contrary to xerox, has support for
introduction of weighted transducers.

For syntactic analysis you will need the Constraint Grammar compiler
vislcg3. It can be obtained from http://visl.sdu.dk/vislcg3/.
Note that Mac users must install ICU (http://...)
If you do not need syntax you may ignore this compiler, and ignore the 
corresponding error message which will come during compilation.


Installation:
=============
Open a terminal window. Stand in st/fao/src (this folder). 

With xerox compilers, write the command:
make

With htst compilers, write the command:
make -f Makefile.hfst

After the compilation process, the analysers can be found in st/fao/bin/


Compiled files:
===============
Here are the compiled files:

Files for use:
--------------
Analysers from xerox compilation
* fao.fst = Faroese analyser
* ifao.fst = Faroese generator

Analysers from hfst compilation
* fao-gen.hfst
* fao.hfst
* fao.hfst.ol

Syntax files
* fao-dep.bin
* fao-dis.bin

For a list of auxiliary files, see below *).


Usage notes:
============
(standing in fao/ (one level up):

morphological analysis:
-----------------------
xerox:
cat textfile | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt \
lookup bin/fao.fst

hfst:
cat textfile | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt \
hfst-optimized-lookup bin/fao.hfst.ol

syntactic analysis: pipe the output from morphology, and do this:
| lookup2cg | vislcg3 -g bin/fao-dis.bin \
| lookup2cg | vislcg3 -g bin/fao-dep.bin \

fao-dis.bin gives syntax and fao-dep.bin gives dependency.
A better dependency analysis is given by using the common dep file::

| lookup2cg | vislcg3 -g bin/fao-dis.bin \
| lookup2cg | vislcg3 -g ../../gt/sme/bin/sme-dep.bin \





*) List of auxiliary files in the bin/ catalogue:
=================================================
Auxiliary files from xerox compilation
* fao.save = Faroese analyser, without initial capital letters
* twol-fao.bin = Faroese analyser

Auxiliary files from xerox compilation
* lexc-fao.hfst
* twol-fao.hfst

General files
* abbr.txt = list of abbreviations for use in preprocessor
* allcaps.fst
* inituppercase.fst
* tagfix.fst
* tok.fst
