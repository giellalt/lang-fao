========================================
 The Faroese morphology and tools
========================================

This directory contains source files for the Faroese language morphology
and dictionary. The data and implementation are licenced under __LICENCE__
licence also detailed in the LICENCE file of this directory. The authors named
in the AUTHORS file are available to grant other licencing choices.

Installation and compilation, and a short note on usage, is documented in the
file INSTALL.

Documentation is scattered around on giellateknos pages, e.g.:

* http://giellatekno.uit.no/faodoc/index.html
* http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/tools/docu-fao-manual.html

Requirements
------------

In order to compile and use Faroese language morphology and dictionaries,
you need:

* Xerox Finite-State Morphology tools, or

* Helsinki Finite-State Technology library and tools, version 3.3.2 or newer

Optionally:

* VislCG3 Constraint Grammar tools

Downloading
-----------

The Faroese language sources can be acquired using `giellatekno SVN
repository <http://divvun.no/doc/infra/anonymous-svn.html>`_, from the
language specific directory, after the core has been downloaded and initial
setup has been performed.

Installation
------------

INSTALL describes the GNU build system in detail, but for most users the usual:

	./configure
	make
	(as root) make install

should result in a local installation and::

	(as root) make uninstall

in its uninstallation.

If you would rather install in e.g. your home directory
(or aren't the system administrator), you can tell ./configure::

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME

If you are checking out the development versions from SVN you must first create
and install the necessary autotools files from the host system, and check that
your environment is correctly set up. This is done by doing:

  ./autogen.sh

It is common practice to keep `generated files out of version control
<http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#CVS>`_.

VPATH builds
------------

If you want to keep the source code tree clean, a VPATH build is the solution.
The idea is to create a build dir somewhere outside of the source code tree,
and call `configure` from there. Here is one VPATH variant of the standard
procedure:

	mkdir build && cd build
	../configure
	make
	(as root) make install

This will keep all the generated files within the build/ dir, and keep the src/
dir (mostly) free of generated files. If you are building from the development
version in SVN, you must run the ./autogen.sh script BEFORE you take the steps
above.

WARNING!!!
----------
Presently there is a bug in Xerox LexC that limits the size of the
input argument to 1023 chars. As VPATH builds tend to increase the character
count in the input string (all filenames are prefixed with a relative path from
the VPATH build dir to the source dir), it is easy to break this limit. If you
follow the simple example above, it will work for some languages, but if you try
to build from a more distant location or for other languages you will be out of
luck (this is also tested and confirmed). At the moment, it is best to avoid
VPATH builds together with the Xerox tools (VPATH  builds using the HFST tool
set should be fine).

A bug report has been sent to the Xerox tools' authors.


For further installation instruction refer to file ``INSTALL``, which contains
the standard installation instructions for GNU autoconf based software.
