########## Lookup and composition adaption ##########
#####################################################

# Due to the way Xerox does lookup, we need to inverse fst's when used with the
# lookup tool, but not when doing composition. This is important to get correct
# e.g. when testing rewrite rules. Hfst does not need any special treatment.

####### HFST build rules: ########

# The fst used for composition should be taken as is, just copy:
%.compose.hfst: %.hfst
	$(AM_V_CP)cp $< $@

# Lookup in Hfst is done in the same direction as it is written, just copy:
%.lookup.hfst: %.hfst
	$(AM_V_CP)cp $< $@

# We also want a generic build rule for making optimised lookup hfst's:
%.hfstol: %.hfst
	$(AM_V_FST2FST)$(HFST_FST2FST) $(HFSTFLAGS) -w -i $< -o $@

####### Xerox build rules: #######

# The fst used for composition should be taken as is, just copy:
%.compose.xfst: %.xfst
	$(AM_V_CP)cp $< $@

# The lookup variant of the Xerox fst needs to be inverted, since Xerox turns
# the fst upside down / backwards when doing lookup:
%.lookup.xfst: %.xfst
	$(AM_V_XFST)$(XFST) $(VERBOSITY) \
			-e "load stack < $<" \
			-e "invert net" \
			-e "save stack $@ " \
			-stop

####### Foma build rules: #######

# The fst used for composition should be taken as is, just copy:
%.compose.foma: %.foma
	$(AM_V_CP)cp $< $@

# The lookup variant of the Xerox fst needs to be inverted, since Xerox turns
# the fst upside down / backwards when doing lookup:
%.lookup.foma: %.foma
	$(AM_V_FOMA)$(FOMA) $(VERBOSITY) \
			-e "load stack $<" \
			-e "invert net" \
			-e "save stack $@ " \
			-s
