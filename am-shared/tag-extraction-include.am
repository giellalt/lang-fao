# DESCRIPTION:
#
# Makefile to extract tags from a transducer. To be included from other
# Makefile's.
#
# Requirement: tag _must_ start with or end with a plus ('+').

# The OR construction needs to be put into a variable for the parentheses to
# survive 'make' and be visible to the shell - this at the same time silences
# grep.
GREPTAGSCOMMAND=( grep -E '(^\+.|.\+$$)' || echo '+NoTagsFound' )

# Extract the sigma set using either HFST or Xfst depending on the configuration
# The sigma extraction is tuned to the peculiarities of both, and does produce
# the exact same output. The sigma set can be used to extract further symbol
# sets. The file sigma.txt contains one symbol pr line, and the whole line
# is the symbol (minus final newline).

if CAN_HFST
# Hfst: break on comma + space in three steps, to preserve space as a symbol.
