This directory should contain tools used by the linguists and developers of each
language. The idea is that it should contain tools useful during the development
of the linguistic resources, while at the same time not being automatisable as
per the Autotools requirements.

Initially it contains shell scripts to generate selected word forms for lemmas
for each continuation lexicon in the given source file. To generate other word
forms, just edit the files. To cover other source files, just copy one of the
existing files, and change it as needed.
