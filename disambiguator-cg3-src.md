# MAPPING OF CC AND CS

Mostly we map both @CNP and @CVP, then we select @CNP, after that we remove them so @CVP remains


* **CCasCNPCVP** Map (@CNP @CVP) to CC

* **killAllahtenotCS** All occurrences of "at" are CSs.







* Kill Sem/ID

* **killAllCNP** removes all remaining @CNP

* **XCC-CS** removes CC and CS with no synttag

* **ErrOrth** goes for correct forms






* **X** removes readings with no syntax
