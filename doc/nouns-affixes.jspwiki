!!!Faroese Noun morphology 


!!!Basic noun lexica 

Taken from the dictionary

The nominal morphology is added in three layers.
In this __first layer__ we add gender tags and morphophonological
diacritics.
The next two layers are for indefinite and definite
suffixes, respectively.


!!Lexicons still to be allocated







!!Irregular nouns

These are lexica with number 0, they have no inflectional morphology.

k0 for januar etc.

kv0 for ommudidd

h0 for indeclinable neuters

irregular_nouns just gives the tags for the indeclinables


!!Lexica for words belonging to two paradigms.
These are simply split (h11/12 to h11 and h12, etc).












!!The ordinary lexica
These lexica split into sg and pl lexica, and add +N and gender tags.
Thereafter it points to Layer 2, the case suffixes
