          <p>The following table records recall for word forms in various
          texts. Here we measure coverage of the vocabulary, by recording all
          word forms that are not recognised.</p>

            <title>Explaining the table</title>

            <p>Lower token than type percentage indicates that the parser
            misses common words more often than seldom ones.</p>

            <p>Lower type than token percentage (which is the case)
            indicates that the parser is good at the core vocabulary,
            but has lacunas in the overall vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Each text is given a separate section in the table, ordered
            chronologically, with the oldest test case (Test 1) at the bottom.
            The first line of each section gives the name of the file (note:
            the files of the test cases 2 and 3 are so changed that these two
            test cases are closed). Each line represents a test run. The first
            colum gives the test date (in the format ddmmyy), the second
            (WFtot) the total number of words in the file question, the third
            (Wf-tkn) the number of recognised word form tokens, and the
            percentage compared to the total. The next columns does the same
            for wordform types (cf. below for the commands used to calculate
            the numbers).</p>

            <source>-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wftot:
cat filename | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | wc -l

Non_recognised_wf:
cat filename | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/fao.fst
 | grep '\?' | grep -v CLB | wc -l

Wf-tkn = Wftot - Non_recognised_wf

%-recall = Wf-tkn * 100 / Wftot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tytot (Total number of wordform types):
cat filename | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l

Non_recognised_wt (Number of non-analysed wordform types:
cat filename | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | sort | uniq |
lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/fao.fst | grep '\?' | grep -v CLB | wc -l

Wf-typ (Number of recognised wordform types)
Wf-typ = Tytot - Non_recognised_wt

%-recall = Wf-typ * 100 / Tytot

If the text is taken from our new /usr/local/share/fao/gt corpus, then
the "cat filename" part should be replaced with
catxml --title --input /usr/local/share/fao/gt/
and thereafter catalogue name and file name.

          <title>Part of speech testing</title>
<p>There has not been a systematic testing of the morphology. A first step for that would be to scan in the paradigms in the dictionary, pair them with grammatical information, and then run the paradigm procedure in the testing/ catalogue.</p>
