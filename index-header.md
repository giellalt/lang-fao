This page documents the work on the **Faroese language model**. It is based upon, and contains the
lemmas from Føroysk orðabók. The analyser is still a bit rough-edged, but it is
good enough to be useful.

The parser is a finite state transducer, capable of analysing and generating any
Faroese wordform. The parser is still under development. In november 2006, it
recognised 85 % of the wordforms in a corpus containing appr. 2.35 million
words. The grammatical part of the parser is written at the University of
Tromsø, and the lexicon is the set of lexemes found in the two-volume
*Føroysk orðabók* (Føroya Fróðskaparfelag 1998).

The project also contains a morphological disambiguator, built upon constraint
grammar technology. The Faroese disambiguator is still in an embryonic state
(as you can verify by testing it out).
