This file contains mappings from abbreviations and some acronyms to full
forms for text-to-speech purposes. This is a supplement to the analyser;
the analyser must tag the strings as +ABBR or similar for the transcriptions
to work. The resulting full form must be lemmas known to the analyser,
for further processing.

We describe here how abbreviations in Faroese are read out,
for text-to-speech systems.

The file contains:

- miscellaneous symbols

- smileys

- Clause boundary symbols

- Single punctuation marks

- Paired punctuation marks
