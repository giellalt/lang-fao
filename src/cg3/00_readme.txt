Fix the faroese functions.cg3 file.

In the LREC paper 2010 (see Antonsen et al) we had a decent functions.cg3 (the Saami one). After that it has been going to and fro between fao and sme for functions.cg3.

The fao of today (5. sept 2019) is checked in as 
fao-functions.cge
just as reference waiting for the issue to be fixed.
