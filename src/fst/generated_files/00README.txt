WHAT IS THIS???!!!

This directory contains generated lexc files (except those generated from xml
and stored in svn) made as part of the build process. This means:

* the files CAN and WILL BE DELETED from time to time
  (e.g. using 'make clean')
* the files SHOULD NOT BE EDITED
* all files in src/morphology/affixes/ and src/morphology/stems/ should be
  committed to svn

Advanced users: if you are using VPATH/out-of-source building, this directory
will be empty (except for this 00README.txt file).
