# typos.txt
# This file contains common typos and their corrections separated by
# a <tab> character, optionally followed by a comment. That is, the
# format is: three columns, separated by TAB:
#
# Column 1: error word/typo
# Column 2: correction
# Column 3: Comment, starting with # or !
#
# Example:
#
# leif	feil	# This is just an example
#
# Corrections that consist of two or more parts are not split
# further in the preprocessor, because there is no way of knowing
# whether the token is a multipart expression or not.
# Beware of removing sentence delimiters (.!?) in correction, since
# they may indicate sentence boundaries.
