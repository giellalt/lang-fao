# This is a shell script that will loop over the *.yaml files of the specified
# transducer type found in this dir
# and run them through the Apertium Quality morph-test.py tool.
#
# It takes one argument: the transducer type.
#
# The script is typically called by a simple shell script listed in the TESTS
# variable in the Makefile.am file, and will then be automatically called when
# issuing 'make check'
#
# This script only contains the loop, and will for each found yaml file call
# the actual test runner.

# Wrong usage - short instruction:
