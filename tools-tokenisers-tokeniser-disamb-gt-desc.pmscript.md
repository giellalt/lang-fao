# Tokeniser for fao

Usage:
```
$ make
$ echo "ja, ja" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "Juos gorreválggain lea (dárbbašlaš) deavdit gáibádusa boasttu olmmoš, man mielde lahtuid." | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "(gáfe) 'ja' ja 3. ja? ц jaja ukjend \"ukjend\"" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "márffibiillagáffe" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
```

Pmatch documentation:
<https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstPmatch>

Characters which have analyses in the lexicon, but can appear without spaces
before/after, that is, with no context conditions, and adjacent to words:
* Punct contains ASCII punctuation marks
* The symbol after m-dash is soft-hyphen `U+00AD`
* The symbol following {•} is byte-order-mark / zero-width no-break space
`U+FEFF`.

Whitespace contains ASCII white space and
the List contains some unicode white space characters
* En Quad U+2000 to Zero-Width Joiner U+200d'
* Narrow No-Break Space U+202F
* Medium Mathematical Space U+205F
* Word joiner U+2060

Apart from what's in our morphology, there are
1. unknown word-like forms, and
2. unmatched strings
We want to give 1) a match, but let 2) be treated specially by
`hfst-tokenise -a`
Unknowns are made of:
* lower-case ASCII
* upper-case ASCII
* select extended latin symbols
* Faroese-specific alphabet
ASCII digits
* select symbols
* Combining diacritics as individual symbols,
* various symbols from Private area (probably Microsoft),
so far:
* U+F0B7 for "x in box"

## Unknown handling
Unknowns are tagged ?? and treated specially with `hfst-tokenise`
hfst-tokenise --giella-cg will treat such empty analyses as unknowns, and
remove empty analyses from other readings. Empty readings are also
legal in CG, they get a default baseform equal to the wordform, but
no tag to check, so it's safer to let hfst-tokenise handle them.

Finally we mark as a token any sequence making up a:
* known word in context
* unknown (OOV) token in context
* sequence of word and punctuation
* URL in context

* * *
