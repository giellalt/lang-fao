# This is the default weight for all editing operations in the error model:
MOB_DEFAULT_WEIGHT=10

# Whether to use swaps - ..ab.. -> ..ba.. in one single operation.
# NB! Beware that this increases the size of the errormodel by ~ 3 * S^2, where
# S is the size of the alphabet. Ie by A LOT.
# If you want to enable swaps, consider using an edit distance of only 1, or
# better yet, dot NOT include UPPERCASE LETTERS in the error model alphabet.
#
# Possible values are 'yes' or 'no'
MOB_USE_SWAPS=no

# Default edit distanse for the generated, alphabet-based error model:
MOB_EDIT_DISTANCE=2

# Define whether we allow changes to the initial letter(s) in the error model,
# possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
# NB!!! Setting this to anything but 'no' will greatly increase the size and
# search space of the error model, and thus make it much, much slower. Make sure
# you TEST the resulting error model properly and thoroughly, both for speed
# and suggestion quality.
MOB_INITIAL_EDITS=no

# Variable to define whether to enable edits of longer strings (as opposed to
# single letters). Possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
MOB_STRING_EDITS=txt
# Variable to specify the edit distance for the regex
# version of the strings file. The total edit distance for those operations is
# this value multiplied with the value of the EDIT_DISTANCE variable.
MOB_STRING_REGEX_EDIT_DISTANCE=2

# Variable to define whether to enable edits of word-final strings (as opposed
# to single letters). Possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
MOB_FINAL_STRING_EDITS=txt

# Variable to define whether to enable whole-word replacements. Possible values:
# - yes
# - no
MOB_WORD_REPLACEMENTS=yes
