# Number of lines (= word forms) in the sort-uniqued corpus. If empty the whole
# corpus will be used. Too large a corpus can make the acceptor fst unneccessary
# big without improving the suggestion quality in a noticable way. A starting
# point could be to only include word forms occurring at least twice. Try
# different values to find the best compromise between fst size and suggestion
# quality.
