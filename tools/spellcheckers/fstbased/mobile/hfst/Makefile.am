# This is the default weight for all editing operations in the error model:
DEFAULT_WEIGHT=10

# Default edit distanse for the generated, alphabet-based error model:
DEFAULT_EDIT_DIST=2

# Define whether we allow changes to the initial letter(s) in the error model,
# possible values are 'yes' or 'no'.
# NB!!! Setting this to 'yes' will greatly increase the size and search space of
# the error model, and thus make it much, much slower. Makre sure you TEST the
# resulting error model properly and thoroughly, both for speeds and suggestion
# quality.
####### NB! This variable has no effect for the time being!!! First letters are
####### modified as part of the regular error model until we are able to formu-
####### late a better way of handling edits to the initial letter(s).
