$Rev: 84086 $
Added a rule to generate phonology documentation from xfscript, not 
only from twolc.

r83997:
Only build one file of tags, using hfst or xfst depending on the configuration.
Extract semantic tags.

r83976:
Reverted a change to hfst lexc compilation - the -f option doesn't work.

r83961:
Moved tag extraction from tagsets to filters, as it has a more general use as
the basis for dynamic filter construction. Tag extraction now works with both
Xerox and Hfst.

r83906:
Xerox will now stop on lexc syntax errors. Hfst will not until (hfst_)foma is
fixed, because foma doesn't stop on syntax errors. But one is better than none.

r83807:
Removed one harmless but irritating warning.

r83736:
Commented out weighting of the acceptor fst - it causes a segfault in
hfst-ospell.

r83655:
Added a filter to remove dynamic derivation.

r83588:
YES! Finally got weighted automatas working in the speller. Added missing hfst
tools, and sorted all the hfst tools alphabetically. Updated the required hfst
to version 3.5.1.

r82738:
Changed build files to support Hfst 3.5, requires 3.5.

r82633:
Added LexSub string filter.

r82452:
Changed voikko compression back to zip - gzip isn't voikko compatible.

r82434:
FINALLY fixed the automake 1.11 vs 1.13 test incompatibilities. Now we can allow
version 1.11, and still get the pretty output we want in newer automakes.

r82406:
Fixed references to GTCORE in test scripts. Earlier we relied solely on it
beingset in the environment, now we take it from configure (which can take it
from the environment or from a script).

r82403:
One more gzip option fix.

r82399:
Fixed argument structure of gzip - zipping was broken for hfst and gramcheck.

r82316:
Consistently use gzip instead of zip, and find gzip outside any conditionals.

r82308:
Redirected command feedback of the analyser shell script to stderr, to avoid
cluttering the analysed text in pipe use.

r82266:
Restored the Makefile and the shell script, now that the dir is merged.

r82261:
Had to remove the Makefile as well, adding only the dir in the first go - no
text replacement was done inside the Makefile.

r82258:
Removed the shell script, to take the merge in two steps: first create the dir,
then add the shell script file. This makes it possible to rename the file at the
same time, whereas if we merge the dir and the file in one go, no renaming will
take place. That leaves us with a tedious manual rename process afterwards.

r82255:
The first lookup shell script added, with supporting infrastructure.

r82231:
Added option to automatically create a language home dir environment variable.
The idea is that by setting this variable, we can reliably find transducers in
the working copy dirs of the users. The default is to not do anything (but give
a warning).

r82207:
Changed back the Automake requirement to 1.11 - 1.12 is creating too much
trouble. We'll have to see what to do with the test output - the version
requirements change must be followed by another change that will substantially
degrade test reports on newer automakes.

r82203:
Made the check for GTCORE functional, looking for both the gt-core.sh script
(and using its output if found), and the environment variable $GTCORE. This
means that there is no need anymore to set the GTCORE variable as long as one
configure, make and make install in the gtcore directory.

r82063:
Corrected bug/feedback e-mail address to one actually working.

r82028:
Made LexC compilation break on error, at least for Xerox (Hfst only gives a
warning for the same error).

r82022:
Moved the remove-illegal-derivation-strings.regex from all langs to only the
three SÃ¡mi langs actually using it. Even though potentially useful for more
languages, it can hardly be considered a language universal...

r81906:
More build rules for the grammar checker. Now it will install.

r81862:
Corrected the --enable-grammarchecker option testing.

r81857:
Changed the order of the configure macros, to allow for testing for program
availability when checking the enable options.

r81854:
Forgot to add the new Makefile to configure.ac.

r81831
Added basic build infrastructure for a CG-based grammar checker. No template
source file added yet, as this is still pretty experimental.

r81653:
Updated the filenames to match what we actually check out.

r81633:
Copy-paste error introduced scanning of a subdir test that doesn't exist for any
language but SME. Now corrected.

r81625:
Reorganised the phonetic build code to better support parallel phonetic
transcription depending on the source language of loan words and foreign names.

r81597:
Added check for the availability of 'see' when testing, to avoid bad fails on
systems without 'see'.

r81592:
Added config feedback about vislcg3/syntactic parsing status. Added config check
for the see tool (SubEthaEdit).

r81588:
Remove copying of the timestamp file for non-maintainers. It breaks the
automatic merge, and requires a revision-explicit merge for each such language.
Also added removal of originating language tags - they are only used in TTS.

r81579:
Added compilation of the remove-orig_lang-tags filter. Sorted the filter
targets.

r81562:
Improved and corrected configure feedback for spellers.

r81556:
Corrected syntax error in a test. Improved config feedback further.

r81551:
Now all speller fst's are turned off by default (I missed a few in the previous
commit). The configure feedback is slightly improved.

r81544:
Changed the default setup to only include morphological analysis and generation.
This is done to reduce the build time during regular development. This means
that to build spellers and other specialised fst's, the must now be enabled
using ./configure. Cf. bugzilla #1710.

r81095:
Corrected filter order for the text2X transcriptors.

r81078:
Completely redid the text2num etc transducers. The previous solution was in the
wrong place, and didn't incorporate the actual filtering. Now it does, but
whether this is the way it should be needs to be tested.

r81065
Another Xerox error correction - we're using LexC, not Xfst. Skipped the result
stack - not needed.

r81054:
Corrected Xerox error.

r81052:
Forgot one small make step.

r81051:
Added the inverse transcriptors, to go from text to numerical expressions.

r81022:
Wrapped phonetic / IPA conversion in a configure option, default is 'no'. Now
compiling SME with Xerox should be back to normal speed again.

r80337:
Added Remove ACR filter.

r80322:
Added compilation of the filters for the orthographic tags, and added removal of
them and the IPA strings in all regular fst's.

r80164:
Added missing hfst tool hfst-fst2strings to the M4 autoconf macros.

r79977:
Forgot to rename a variable after copy-paste.

r79929:
Reorganised the build code for dictionaries, added a dictionary option for
configure (disabled by default), and added the new filter for mobile keyboard
spellrelax.

r79408:
Still one more case of optimised lookup format removed. The underlying problem
remains, though: that the hfst tools can't take all produced formats as input.
Also added gzip compression of the att file transferred to Apertium.

r79402:
Another bugfix: switched from -f owl to -t in another case, to avoid hfst crash.

r79373:
Bugfix: hfst-substitute can't take lookup-optimised fst's as input.

r79338:
Removed a sma-specific filter that had crept in. Added att output fst to the
default apertium analyser target.

r79327:
Added missing check and variable definition for hfst-fst2txt. Several minor
changes to the apertium build instructions.

r79316:
Added missing reference to the remove-semantic-tags-except-prop filter.

r79315:
One small change forgotten in the previous commit: comments and one less target
in the default setup (more to be added on a per-language base).

r79308:
Moved MT/Apertium code to the und template from sma. Not tested, most likely
buggy.

r79152:
Added remove-variant-string.regex, for removing strings containing +v2,
+v3, +v4, +v5, but not removing +v1.

r79081:
Change echo to printf for cross-platform compatibility.

r79057:
Improved error handling in testing shell scripts.

r78956:
Removed -s option from hfst-summarise in tagsets/ and added # -> + to the 
Apertium relabel script 

r78059:
Renamed refs to template dir in preparation for support for multiple template
dirs.

r77898:
Commented out examples of error models for string and word pairs - they would in
most cases add symbols to the error model not found in the acceptor, and this
combination would crash the speller badly.

r77567:
Cleaned up speller fst building, removing all unnecessary inverts and
streamlining the code. Prepared for the introduction of weights, but commented
out for now because of bugs or inefficiences in openfst. Renamed the included
hfst speller build file, to follow an emerging naming standard for the include
files.

r77523:
Added support for making variant analysers and generators using the Apertium tag
convensions. The generated transducers are still not fully Apertium-compatible
but they are a major step forward.

r77475:
Renamed analyser-raw-gt-desc.hfst to generator-raw-gt-desc.hfst, to make the
behavior in hfst-lookup explicit and clear. Still, the "generator" behaves as
the Xerox "analyser" in hfst when in comes to composition and filtering.
Confusing, I know.

r77459:
Build the filter to remove CLB strings from speller transducers, and use it.

r77449:
Added missing hfst tools. Removed commented-out code in the index.xml file.

r77368:
Removed the ocr error model from the zhfst building, it causes libvoikko 3.4 to
segfault.

r77364:
Added an explicit copy operation into the hfst speller dir, to facilitate local
modifications of the speller transducer before further processing, by just
replacing the copy operation with whatever is needed.

r77356:
Added string pairs and whole-word corrections to the speller error model.
Added support for an ocr error model. Removed obsolete Voikko config file.
Corrected bugs in the hfst M4 macros.

r77317:
Moved the initial spell checker processing to the top spellchecker dir, to serve
as the default starting point for all spell checkers.

r77273:
Added a tagset directory in preparation for generating Apertium transducers
automatically. Corrected and expanded a few M4 macros for the hfst tools.

r76046:
Added support for testing analysers and generators only. For several of our more
specialised transducers, this is more practical and useful than always
generating both pairs of transducers to test both directions.

r75902:
Corrected the existing oahpa transducer. Added dummy hfst oahpa target.

r75594:
Corrected a bug in the hyphenator hfst build: fst's must be inverted in hfst.

r75459:
Corrected another copy-paste error that broke speller fst's.

r75424:
Corrected copy-paste error.

r75423:
Rewrote a number of targets to reflect a splitted morph boundary removal filter.
There are now three filters instead of one, to allow for more flexible fst
building for speech processing.

r75275:
Added gzip compression of foma speller transducer, and proper checks for
prerequisites. Foma spellers can now be disabled, they are enabled by default.

r75256:
Corrected a bug when building foma-based spellers. Changed one fst filename to
follow the naming scheme for the new infra. Improved building of the zfst
speller file.

r74922:
Added processing of new filters.

r74604:
Do not try to build hfst-based tools if hfst building is not enabled.

r74427:
Forgot to include changes to the filters Makefile.am in the previous commit.

r74424:
Moved some of the fst-speller building one level up, and added support for
building foma-based spellers.

r74285:
Renamed phonetics source and target files to reflect the actual purpose.

r74259:
Added possibility to build morph segmenter for those langs that have morph
boundaries marked in lexicons.

r74234:
Added a top-level misc/ dir to hold private / non-svn files needed during
development of the language. All files are ignored.

r74072:
Corrected hfst 2ipa fst: the final fst needs to be inverted before being used in
lookup.

r74012:
Corrected the homonymy and variant filters used for generators - those tags
should be optional, not completely removed.

r73986:
We require gawk specifically, not any awk whatsoever. Improved config feedback.

r73341:
Corrected reference to the built fst's.

r73159:
Updated the zhfst building to reflect recent changes in Voikko. There is now
official support for zhfst speller files, but with a new location and no *.pro
file. Also added simple support for local loading of the zhfst file -
voikkospell requires that the file is located within a dir named '3'.

r72875:
Further improvements to the test run output.

r72864:
More tweaks to make the test output compact and readable.

r72854:
Made use of the more compact modes of morph-tester.py. For all PASSed test runs,
only one line is printed.

r72836:
Moved Oahpa transducer compilation to a separate (included) file, and added
support for compiling dictionary transducers.

r72827:
We need the last part of the path to properly identify the lexc file tested.

r72823:
Made the morph-tester test runner (LexC and YAML tests) less verbose. All
messages are one-liners, except for FAILs.

r72769:
More thorough clean in src/morphology/.

r72662:
Moved the definitions of the transducer variables to the Makefile.am, to make it
possible to extend them by local modifications.

r72560:
Forgot to update the src/filter/Makefile.am file.

r72534:
Split the filter 'remove-dictionary-tags' in two to remove homonymy and variant
tags separately.

r72518:
Added filter to remove NGminip strings, ie paths that should not be used for
generating miniparadigms in dictionaries.

r72423:
Added infrastructure for building fst's for list-based spellers. The actual
building is not yet implemented.

r71921:
Remove doc build dir when cleaning.

r71912:
Forgot to update the config file.

r71905:
Reorganised the tools/ dir to fit better with coming development.

r71576:
Several adjustments to the forrest setup for jspwiki validation.

r71421:
Added support files to enable forrest validation of jspwiki files. Second part
of making sure extracted documentation comments won't break site building. Also
added another make step to actually run forrest at the end of building the
documentation. Make will now break if there are fatal errors in the jspwiki
markup.

r71326:
Corrected cut&paste error.

r71325:
Added check for forrest as part of configuring the documentation extraction.
Forrest will be used to validate the jspwiki documents during the build, to
avoid that invalid documents enter the svn repository and corrupts the web page
building.

r71071:
Upped the required automake version from 1.11 to 1.12, to avoid all hassles with
the test harnesses and backwards compatibility.

r71052:
And then the rest of the tests changed into the most portable format.

r71025:
Even more portable testing...

r71002:
Improved portability & correctness of conditional tests in the morphology
testing.

r70961:
Major update to the LexC testing. Now test data directly in the LexC code is
supported by the python test script morph-tester.py (it reads the lexc files
directly), which solves the bugs with multiple wordforms for the same
morphosyntactic inflection. It is also a bit faster than the awk solution.

r70633:
Added initial documentation extraction of CG3 files. Probably more work to be
done to get things working as intended.

r68844:
Finally found out how to get the old test behaviour back. We want the serial
tests, because it gives direct feedback to the linguists. Automake 1.13 uses
parallel testing by default, which logs all test results to files.

r68823:
Added support for processing twolc files for documentation extraction.

r68816:
Some files may contain digits in their filename. Extended the filename match
pattern for the Links target.

r68806:
Added support for automatically building a file with links to each individual
jspwiki file generated based.

r68760:
Forgot to add the jspwiki preamble file. Now added.

r68649:
Added some very basic documentation comments to the template root.lexc.

r68639:
Forgot to add support for the conditional CAN_DOCC in the previous commit.

r68630:
Added initial support for extracting documentation from comments in the source
code. Only jspwiki supported initially. Also added initial support for
extracting test data from source code comments. Only yaml tests in lexc is
supported initially.

r67871:
The final fix to get the XML-to-LexC conversion working on Cygwin.

r67860:
Concatenate all LexC source files into one file explicitly, instead of letting
hfst-lexc do it. This is more robust cross-platform, and makes the file used for
transducer compilation easily available for debugging.

r67840:
Corrected the host detection test for Cygwin.

r67828:
Made spell-relax a language-specific file by adding it to the und template.

r67827:
Added support for XSL conversion of XML source files on Cygwin.

r67732:
Made Voikko support optional instead of required.

r67724:
Fixed a stupid bash syntax error in the previous commit.

r67720:
Rewrote LexC and TwolC Xerox rules to make them work on Cygwin: the Windows
Xerox tools need a script file as input, the scripts can't be piped in as on
*nix systems. Removed the hack in the previous commit. The bug can be worked
around by avoiding linebreaks in the piped script.

r67563:
Added hack to work around a very strange bug in LexC transducer saving - the
filename is slightly garbled if the save command is passed in from a script
generated by a make file (but the same command passed in from a manually typed
script works correctly).

r67353:
More robust Saxon/Java setup: no need to define CLASSPATH. The M4 macros will
look for a couple of predefined pathnames, and pick the first saxon9he.jar file
it finds. More locations should be added as needed.

r67309:
Require at least HFST 3.4 - it includes all backends, and simplifies dependency
handling quite a bit.

r67043:
Fixed parsing of regexes for hfst, due to a bug in hfst-regex2fst when parsing
regexes with comments after the regex is closed.

r66959:
Refactored the yaml test code, moving duplicate parts to a separate file. Makes
for much easier adaption to new transducer types.

r66833;
First step in making the digit transcriptor transducers work. The transducers
are compiled, and are given proper names according to the fst naming
conventions, and the Xerox transducers work in the digit-2-string direction. The
Hfst transducers do not yet work (segmentation fault due to running out of
memory because of an infinite recursion), and the string-2-digit direction is
not yet in place.

r66815:
Made the yaml test scrips obey configuration options, ie only run the hfst tests
if hfst is turned on at configuration time.

r66329:
Automake requirement reduced to 1.11, after getting confirmation that that
version is fine for finding Python (the main problem issue that triggered the
version requirement).

r66316:
There's too much trouble with finding the correct Python version when using
Automake v.1.10. We thus require 1.12 from now on.

r66241:
The noun lemma generation test script has been updated to only test the
transducer types that have been turned on at configuration time.

r65468:
Grep out comments from regex files in orthography/, as there is a bug in
hfst-regexp2fst.

r65380:
The actual Oahpa configuration was lost! Now finally included and working.

r65377:
Forgot Oahpa configuration feedback.

r65376:
Several updates:
* slightly improved feedback from the configure script
* improved hfst spell checker building
* added basic support for building Oahpa transducers, *disabled* by default

r65370:
Renamed 'dictionary' `spellerautomaton` in giellatekno.m4. The old variable name
and printouts were confusing - 'dictionary' has manh meanings, and some very
concrete ones in the context of the GT/Divvun work.

r65289:
Minimise after every compose operation - always.

r65064:
Bug fixes to the Saxon/Java configuration.

r65002:
Call saxon checks from confugre.
In previous commit: Ubuntu version of xml2lexc with autostuff.

r64988:
Only check hfst version if requested using '--with-hfst', otherwise disable.
Likewise, disable xfst if requested and print warning if both are disabled.

r64645:
Added simple feedback to autogen.sh, valuable when processing many languages.
Some reformatting of am-shared/hfst-spellchecker-include.am.

r64584:
Removed double inversion from the hfst generator - it didn't work.

r64568:
One more syntax error.

r64567:
Corrected syntax errors introduced in the previous commit.

r64566:
Silenced the build using an Automake macro.

r64560:
Make the silent build rules backwards compatible.

r64552:
Reapplied the simplification of hfst regex expressions, now with the correct
command, thus working. Corrected hfst filter compilation. Took the first steps
in silencing the verbose make output.

r64550:
Reverted the simplification of hfst regex compilation.

r64539:
Added support for spellrelax. Also renamed the orthography include file to be
more generic. Simplified regex build commands now that the bugs in
hfst-regexp2fst have been corrected.

r63846:
hfst-preprocess-for-optimized-lookup-format has been removed from the hfst
distribution.

r63795:
Always fail hfst check if hfst-info can't be found.

r63667:
Add requirement of foma for hfst compilation; remove distinction between
WANT_[HX]FST and CAN_[HX]FST.

r63602:
The local modifications to Makefile.am files must be before the fallback pattern
targets, it seems, otherwise the fallback targets are used.

r63579:
I believe I finally have fixed the yaml testing shell scripts.

r63573:
One more fix for the yaml testing shell scripts.

r63571:
Escaping in the yaml test scripts didn't work - removing the single quotes did.
Also added an underscore in front of the transducer string in the yaml testing,
to avoid that the test scripts get too greedy when we get more transducers and
test data.

r63557:
Small variable correction in the yaml test bench.

r63556:
Forgot to escape the single quotes used within the backtic expression.

r63527:
Corrected fail check in noun lemma generation test.

r63522:
Split the yaml test runner in two, one for norm and one for desc transducers,
and updated the autoconf file correspondingly. Updated the lemma generator test
to work with the renamed transducer. Made all test runners more robust.

r63501:
Renamed all existing targets to follow the naming scheme defined at
http://divvun.no/doc/infra/infraremake/TransducerNamesInTheNewInfra.html. Also
added making of true normative and descriptive analysers and generators, as well
as moved all of the hfst speller building to the
tools/spellcheckers/hfstspeller/ dir. More explicit separation of local and
central code in src/.

r63483:
Added a simple header to the beginning of the compilation, to make it easier to
spot each new language when building all languages in $GTHOME/langs/.

r63469:
With the recent fixes to regexp parsing in hfst-regexp2fst it was possible to
bring the hfst compilation up to par with the Xerox compilation. In principle
the Xerox and Hfst transducers should behave exactly the same - any deviation is
a candidate bug in either the Xerox or the Hfst tools. This update requires hfst
3.3.14 to work properly, the requirement is added to the configure.ac file.

r63149:
Removed references to newinfra/.

r63144:
Added warning about missing YAML testing, with short instructions on how to
enable them.

r62953:
The top-level syntax include AM file had not been changed to reflect the
rle->cg3 suffix change.

r62867:
Corrected a bug in the default generate-noun-lemmas.sh test script. Made file
references more robust.

r62683:
Variables=cleaner code.

r62663:
Updated the yaml test runner to properly report the exit value of the yaml
tests, and also to give directions for how to see the details of each test if it
failed.

r62650:
Corrected typo in shell scripts.

r62648:
Several testing shell script updates: correct exit value when data files are not
found, proper use of Autoconf-made variables (will free the test scripts from
relying on the user setting up environment variables), and better checks on the
availability of test data for the lemma generation test.

r62643:
Added check for the Xerox lookup tool, which also defines the LOOKUP variable.

r62639:
Reorganised AC processing of shell scripts to be more future-proof. Added AC
variable to the AC-processed shell script to make casual by-lookers aware of the
fact that the resulting shell script file is generated by AC.

r62635:
Moved Autoconf processing of the yaml testing shell script to the top of the
list of AC_CONFIG_FILES, to avoid annoying warnings from chmod.

r62621:
Corrected error in previous commit.

r62619:
Forgot to update configure.ac.

r62617:
Refined the yaml test runner: more informative banner, ignore extra analyses
(= removes false alarms).

r62610:
Added basic setup for running YAML tests in the test/src/morphology/ dir. The
default setup will run all *.yaml files found in this dir, but this can be
modified in the shell (*.sh.in) script.

r62596:
Enable yaml tests by magic.

r62590:
Added conditional support for running python-based tests in test/src/morphology.

r62581:
Added checks for Python 3.1+ and py-yaml, and defined CAN_YAML_TEST. The idea is
that we will run the python-based tests only if the prerequisites are available
to us, and skip them if not.

r62276:
Added missing entries in configure.ac and src/Makefile.am.

r62275:
Added support for transcribing transducers, ie transducers that change the input
from one orthographical representation to another, e.g. date and time
expressions as strings or digits to the opposite form.

r62270:
Renamed the default error model file, to follow the naming scheme used in the
zhfst guidelines.

r62265:
Don't remove the *.tmp files - that destroys the dependency relationships for
(auto)make, which forces a full recompilation of all target fst's, and a lot of
extra waiting time.

r62192:
Add missing src to hfst spellchecker automaton path

r62171:
Added missing reference to dialect tag filter.

r62151:
Updated my simplistic noun generation script to be aware of its new location.

r62147:
Corrected typo in Makefile list in AC_CONFIG_FILES.

r62145:
Forgot to add the new Makefile's to the list of AC_CONFIG_FILES.

r62141:
Reorganised the test dir, in anticipation of a larger set of tools and source
types in need of testing.

r62122:
Added test/data/typos.txt to hold a list of collected typos. The list is used
both for testing spellers, and as part of the preprocessor used with the Xerox
lookup tool.

r62084:
Added core filters for making transitivity and semantic tags optional in the
default generator. This change fixes most of the generation issues.

r62039:
Generalised the local/language-specific *fst processing.

r62010:
Adding support for local/language-specific *fst processing.

r61971:
Reverting the copy source file step for $GTCORE/gtshare/src/filters/, replacing
it with direct compilation. The main reason for copying was to have the source
files available for distribution, but that is not required, since the
distribution and installations of the languages depends on the presence of
GTCORE. Instead we risk that people start to add the copied source files to svn.

r61965:
The GT_FILTER_TARGETS variable needs to be parametrised for HFST and Xerox also
for the local modifications.

r61961:
Several small typos and glitches in building the main xfst's fixed.

r61959:
Removed an extraneous backslash that broke compilation.

r61954:
Hopefully this version of cp will work.

r61953:
Forgot to force the copy, which stopped the compilation.

r61949:
Added several (tag removal) filters from the old infra, and added compilation of
them as well. Applied (composed) them on the generator and the analyser, such
that the gen. and anal. should now produce the same output as in the old infra.
Corrected the README file.

r61776:
Remove duplicate methods to enable toolkits; --with-options are to be used
with optional path to tools. The automake tree will still have two
conditionals on whether CAN and WANT hfst, xfst or somesuch

r61734:
Added border removal to the basic analyser and generator, such that they become
useful.

r61731:
Made the first test script more robust: it bails out if no transducer is found,
and gives basic feedback to whether it is testing Xerox or Hfst. The test data
files are not deleted after the test run, so that they can be easily inspected
if needed, even after a successful test run. It also uses the more common
filename and morphological tags (=less typing by default).

r61723:
Added the first test script: it tests whether noun lemmas do generate. The
script does contain some language-specific bits, and must thus be adapted to the
requirements of each language.

r61712:
Corrected reference to inituppercase.?fst.

r61708:
Corrected compilation of hyphenation rules.

r61706:
Corrected compilation of phonetic/orth2ipa rules.

r61685:
Added basic structure for hyphenation and conversion to IPA.

r61658:
Added an empty Hunspell dir to indicate the home of Hunspell building.

r61640:
Removed (auto)make processing of the now deleted src/spellchecker/ dir.
Refactored the phonotactics processing, such that xfst script files are on an
equal foot with twolc files, and such that it is easy to switch from one to the
other. Also added some basic template files for disambiguation and dependency
tagging, taken from the faroese source.

r61605:
Reorganized spell checker build structure, moving it to a new tools/ dir, which
will also be home to other applications of the basic linguistic analysers.

r61603:
Added build support for xml source files.

r61520:
Added initial support for xml source files.
NB! The support isn't fully according to GNU (autotools) standards yet, but will have to do for the moment.

r61472:
Reverted the ignores - merging wasn't working properly for properties, and
caused a lot of noise. Hopefully this commit will cancel that noise.

r61464:
Added svn:ignore on most dirs, in the hope that they will be copied over to the
language dirs.

r61458:
A lot of cleanup and corrections:
* suffix rules in more places (although not in all - that is not possible)
* removed automake warning about pattern rules - we need them
* checked all *-include.am files for consistency, added missing Xerox and HFST
  targets were needed, corrected vars to HFST tools, added comments and
  generally made the files easier to maintain (I hope).

r61422:
Only pattern rules for uppercasing targets.

r61380:
Replaced pattern rules with suffix rules in phonology (twolc) processing. First
step in switching to suffix rules everywhere, for backwards compatibility, and
fewer automake errors. Also added support for compiling phonologies written as
xfst script files.

r61346:
Added Autoconf processing of the Makefile.am files in test/.

r61318:
More elaborate dir structure in test/, added Makefile.am files everywhere in
test/, added test/ to SUBDIRS.

r59870:
Include filters and indent properly, use gtcore version of editdist.py in
spellers

r59759:
Corrected syntax error, renamed a couple of errors.

r59755:
Finally added initial uppercase to the actual analysing transducer. NB! It
presently works only for Xerox transducers. The code for HFST looks correct to
me, but it still doesn't work. Will have to debug this further later.

r59728:
Corrected file suffix match for xfst script files.

r59707:
Revert tests

r59705:
Test commit

r59643:
Added uppercasing compilation including proper processing for HFST. Uppercasing
is not yet applied to the output transducers. That is coming in a second commit.
Added a variable for hfst-xfst (and tested for its existence).

r59115:
Corrected dependency for speller transducer. Corrected filter path.

r59113:
Correct the path of merge instructions.

r59079:
Added filter compilation and processing of fst's.

r58484:
Corrected path to speller metadata files, corrected commands for them.

r58482:
Updated zhfst building according to new location of files.

r58478:
Replaced direct command calls with variables, completed and corrected a couple
of commands, made the transducer commands consistent across applications.

r58471:
The timestamp file has been renamed, with corresponding changes in the
Makefile.am.

r58456:
Making the echo silent for clean output.

r58409:
Renamed a couple of folders and files, moved hfst & voikko speller metadata
files to a more appropriate place.

Updated the top Makefile.am to properly check for changes to this file before
building anything else.
